These MATLAB scripts predict match results using Machine Learning, based on attributes provided in European Soccer Database [1].
<br>
Scripts folders:
- I: simple neural network using data of each company.
- II: multilayer neural network using data of each company.
- III: multilayer neural network using data of all companies.
- IV: KMeans using data of each company.

For each classifier, K-Fold validation has been implemented to measure accuracy statistics.
